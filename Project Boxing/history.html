<h1>History of Boxing</h1>
<p>Boxing is one of the most popular games, especially in Europe and the Americas.<br> Legends like Muhammad Ali, Jack Johnson, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Benny <br>Leonard, Mickey Walker along with many stars have brought worldwide fame and<br> recognition to the sport. Boxing was earlier known by<br> the name Pugilism, <br>meaning sweet science.<br>

Historical evidence lead to the fact that boxing was prevalent in North Africa <br>in 4000 BC. It was also popularly played in Greek and Rome. The rules were crude then and boxers often indulged in <br> lethal boxing rounds with leather taped <br>on their bare hands. It is believed that In Ancient Rome, the boxing <br>fighters were usually offenders and slaves. They played the game to win and <br> gain independence. However, facts also point to free men fighting for <br>competition and the spirit of sport. Eventually, Augustus is known to have banned fighting. It is also said that in 500 <br> A.D. Theodoric banned the sport, <br>owing to its popularity and growing distraction caused in public life.<br> 

The first signs of documented records take you to the year 1681 in Britain. It <br>is a popular belief that the Duke of Albemarle held a boxing competition between his butcher and butler. The <br>common reason for such matches is believed to be amusement and fun.<br> 
<br> 
Prior to 1866, Jack Boughtonis is credited with establishing a set of rules for boxing. It is said<br> Jack decided to publish the rules in 1743 after a grisly match with one of his opponents who died <br> during the match. The legend was popularly known as the ‘Father of Boxing’.<br> 

In Ancient Rome, the boxing fighters were usually offenders and slaves playing to win and gain <br>independence.
However, the more recognizable development occurred during a time known as modern era in boxing. In<br> the year 1866, the Marquess of Queensberry consented to a new set of boxing rules. The rules <br> were titled with his name. The new rules introduced limited number of 3-minute rounds. It also <br>banned gouging and wrestling during the match and made gloves compulsory. It took a while for <br> bare-knuckled fights to completely go out of fashion, but there was considerable decrease after the <br> rule was passed. In 1892, James Corbett set this rule straight by defeating the bare-fisted boxer <br>John Sullivan with the new established rules.

Another radical change in the sport can be traced to Douglass. It was John Douglass who gave birth<br> to the modern day boxing rules way back in 1865. Famous as the ‘Patron Saint’, Douglass has <br> contributed to systematic game of boxing. He made 12 prominent rules, the most significant ones <br>being three-minute rounds and approved standards for boxing gloves.<br> 

There was no looking back for the sport during early 1900s. Boxing was on list in the St. Louis <br>games in 1904. Throughout the 20th century, the world witnessed gifted fighters who fought for <br> titles and bestowed the game with world known recognition and popularity. Boxing was heading <br>straight into the 21st century with grace and aplomb.<br> 
<br> 
In 1902, a London dentist by the name Jack Marles invented the first mouth guard for boxers. The<br>  mouth guards were basically designed for training sessions. In 1913, Welterweight fighter Ted "Kid" <br>Lewis became the first boxer to use a protective mouthpiece in the prize ring. The mouthpiece soon became popular and gained acclaim in the sport of boxing.<br> 

The establishment of National Boxing Association (NBA) in 1927 ensured a fair governing body that <br>looked into the game and its success. The main aim of the NBA was to arrange championships between <br> the best talents and look after boxing ethics and popularity of the game. We have three <br> world-acclaimed boxing organizations today—the WBC, IBF and the WBA. The International Amateur <br> Boxing Association was formed in 1946 and it is the first international body for amateur boxing.<br>

Some other glorious names in the history of boxing include Gene Tunney, Corbett and Sullivan for <br> heavy weight category, as also lightweight champions Barney Ross and Henry Armstrong. The boxing <br>history offers insight into many stalwart moments of the game.</p>
